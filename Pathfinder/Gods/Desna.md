Desna is an ancient goddess of freedom and luck, and is credited with the creation of the heavens. In her earliest days the god [Curchanus](https://pathfinder.fandom.com/wiki/Curchanus "Curchanus"), an enemy of the goddess [Lamashtu](https://pathfinder.fandom.com/wiki/Lamashtu "Lamashtu"), was her mentor. Lamashtu laid a trap for Curchanus and stripped him of his beast domain, ripping it from his godly essence. As he died he gifted Desna with the domain of travel; she has traveled the planes and worlds since, opposing both oppression and Lamashtu wherever she encounters them, and spreading her word while making an effort to experience new wonders when she can.[[3]](https://pathfinder.fandom.com/wiki/Desna#cite_note-PF2-3)
