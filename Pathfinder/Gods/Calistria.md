**Calistria** (pronounced kah-LISS-tree-ah)[[1]](https://pathfinder.fandom.com/wiki/Calistria#cite_note-1) is a goddess of many faces and guises, including lust and revenge. She is held in especially high regard by [elves](https://pathfinder.fandom.com/wiki/Elves "Elves"), who often identify her moods and attitude with that of their people. A fondness of wasps has earned this vengeful deity the title the Savored Sting; such creatures live on after harming their enemies, a trait to be emulated should one seek to inflict pain on another.[[2]](https://pathfinder.fandom.com/wiki/Calistria#cite_note-CS161-2)
