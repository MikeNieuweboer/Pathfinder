Before he successfully completed the Test of the _Starstone_ in [2765 AR](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/2765_AR "2765 AR"),[4](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Cayden_Cailean#cite_note-gazetteer-20-4) the man known as Cayden Cailean was a [Taldan](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Taldan "Taldan") sellsword and freedom fighter working out of [Absalom](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Absalom "Absalom"). He strongly believed that no man should hold power over another, and went so far as to leave jobs unfinished rather than violate his principles. His refusal to compromise his ideals was as well known as his love for drink, and the combination of the two resulted in a less-than-favorable reputation among potential employers. Ultimately, however, the latter would lead to the man's apotheosis.[5](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Cayden_Cailean#cite_note-campaign-setting-161-5)[2](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Cayden_Cailean#cite_note-children-of-the-void-56-63-2)

Cailean never planned to become a [god](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/God "God"), but when a drunk friend challenged him to take the Test of the _Starstone_, an equally inebriated Cailean accepted, forgetting that only two mortals, [Aroden](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Aroden "Aroden") and [Norgorber](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Norgorber "Norgorber"), had passed the test. Another story claims (to Cayden's chagrin[6](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Cayden_Cailean#cite_note-inner-sea-gods-42-6)) that Cayden was prompted to take the Test after his advances had been rejected by the goddess [Calistria](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Calistria "Calistria") herself. Legends abound regarding the challenges Cailean faced at the _Starstone_, but no one knows the truth of what happened. Regardless, after three days had passed, the sellsword—to everyone's surprise, including his own—emerged as a deity. He could not remember how he had passed the test, but continued as a god in much the same way as he had when he was a mortal: doing whatever he wanted, fighting for just causes, and enjoying the drink.[5](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Cayden_Cailean#cite_note-campaign-setting-161-5)[7](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Cayden_Cailean#cite_note-the-inner-sea-world-guide-219-7)

Cayden Cailean holds freedom and adventure in high regard, and opposes tyranny and oppression on principle. He willingly accepts challenges when they are issued, although not as a point of honor; he sees no shame in retreating when necessary. One instance of note is the fall of the devil [Salicotal](https://pathfinderwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Salicotal&action=edit&redlink=1 "Salicotal (page does not exist)"), who grew infuriated with Cailean during a duel of dares, and attacked—only to be defeated—at the hands of the god.[2](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Cayden_Cailean#cite_note-children-of-the-void-56-63-2)
